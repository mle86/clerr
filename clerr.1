.SH NAME
clerr \- colorize error output
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBclerr\fR
[\fB-1hV\fR]
[\fB-c\fR \fICOLOR\fR]
\fICOMMAND\fR
[\fIARGUMENTS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBclerr\fR is a command line tool which executes another \fICOMMAND\fR and colorizes all error output (on stderr) of that program while its normal output (on stdout) will be printed in the default colors.

The command to be executed may be followed by any number of arguments which will be passed to the command just as if calling it without \fBclerr\fR -- therefore the \fBclerr\fR call may be regarded as an execution modifying prefix.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-1
All output will be printed on stdout only, even error output (which will still get colorized).
.TP
.B \-c \fICOLOR
Set the color for error output.
Default is \fIred\fR. Valid colors and their abbrevations (also valid) are:

.IR red / re / rd ,
.IR green / gr / gn ,
.IR blue / bl ,
.IR yellow / ye / yw ,
.IR cyan / cy / cn ,
.IR white / wh .
.TP
.B \-h
\fBclerr\fR will print a short help summary and exit.
.TP
.B \-V
\fBclerr\fR will print its program version and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
clerr cat /etc/group-
This will display the file \fI/etc/group-\fR in standard colors.
If the file does not exist or the caller is not permitted to read this file, the corresponding error message (something like "cat: /etc/group-: No such file or directory") will be printed in red.
.TP
clerr make
Run \fBmake\fR in the current directory. Any compiling errors will be printed in red.
